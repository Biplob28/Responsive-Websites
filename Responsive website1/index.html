            <p class="submainpart text-small">The educational system in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and
                gurukulas. This was similar to the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn
                either in their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country,
                the general public had no access to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School,
                established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in
                1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse population.
                The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that Nepal is fulfilling only 83.5% of what it
                should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country's level of income HRMI breaks down
                the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While
                taking into consideration Nepal's income level, the nation is achieving 95.4% of what should be possible
                based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 71.5% for secondary education.
